ToDo
====

Add definition of values to grammar (and/or dynamic semantics).

Give a proof of the fact that the M of the MATCH state is always either empty or contains 1 element.

Change if to branch on a boolean type, and add a boolean rule to the grammar
to allow for general expression comparison.

Add pre-processing step to implementation to re-parse arithmetic operations
correctly (low prioirty atm - want to implement the subset that was the original
grammar first).
