ToDo
====

Test all grammar rules.

Change if to branch on a boolean type, and add a boolean rule to the grammar
to allow for general expression comparison.

Add pre-processing step to implementation to re-parse arithmetic operations
correctly (low prioirty atm - want to implement the subset that was the original
grammar first).
