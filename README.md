# About
Midi-FreshML is a functional ML-like language with additional features for metaprogramming. It is based on [Fresh OCaml] (http://www.fresh-ocaml.org), an extended version of OCaml, which was developed by Mark Shinwell. Midi-FreshML is being developed as part of my part II project for the [Cambridge University Computer Science tripos] (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk).

# Installing
Midi-FreshML builds with Ocaml version 3.12.1. Other versions have not been tested.
To build it, checkout the repo and run `make`.

To build the benchmark used for testing the performance of delayed permutations you will need to install the [OCaml Benchmark module] (ocaml-benchmark.forge.ocamlcore.org), and then run `make bench`.
